# Statistics_Debt-collection-strategies

This project seeks to determine whether assigning delinquent customers to a higher debt recovery strategy is worth the incremental amount the bank has to pay by analyising regression discontinuity. The bank has implemented different recovery strategies at different thresholds ($1000, $2000, etc.). Each additional level of recovery strategy requires an additional $50 per customer so that customers in the Recovery Strategy Level 1 cost the company $50 more than those in Level 0. Customers in Level 2 cost $50 more than those in Level 1, etc.
